                <p class="mm-all-text-bottom">Fission in the reactor releases heat that is used to boil water. A reactor is comparable with an enormous water boiler, where 1,000 liters of water reaches boiling point in one second, creating steam.</p>

            <!-- Second info box -->

                <span class="mm-all-text-btn "><h1 class="mm-h1">2</h1></span>
                <p class="mm-all-text-bottom">The steam is funneled to turbines. Under high pressure, the steam hits the blades mounted on the turbine shaft, which causes the shaft to spin at 3,000 revolutions per minute.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Third info box -->
            <div id="mm-third-info" class="mm-all-info">
                <span class="mm-all-text-btn "><h1 class="mm-h1">3</h1></span>
                <p class="mm-all-text-bottom">The turbine shaft is in turn connected to a generator that produces the electricity. The electricity is transferred from the generator to users via power lines.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Fourth info box -->
            <div id="mm-fourth-info" class="mm-all-info">
                <span class="mm-all-text-btn "><h1 class="mm-h1">4</h1></span>
                <p class="mm-all-text-bottom">The steam from the turbine is sucked down into a condenser, where it interfaces with cold seawater that is pumped into the condenser via numerous tube bundles. The steam comes into contact with the tube surfaces, cools down and turns into water again. The seawater is pumped back out to sea, 10–12°C hotter than when it was pumped in.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Fith info box -->
            <div id="mm-fith-info" class="mm-all-info">
                <span class="mm-all-text-btn "><h1 class="mm-h1">5</h1></span>
                <p class="mm-all-text-bottom">The water in the condenser is pumped back into the reactor to be boiled again. It takes about 10 minutes for the very smallest drop of water – a single water molecule – to complete a full cycle within the process. The process water is thus held in a closed loop and the seawater coolant never comes into contact with the reactor’s steam.</p>
